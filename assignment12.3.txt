1)Explain the uses of NoSQL Databases in brief and list the current NoSQL databases which are available:-

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
The data structures used by NoSQL databases are different from those used in relational databases which makes some operations faster in NoSQL.
It has simpler design and simpler horizontal scaling to clusters of machines.
The data structures used by NoSQL databases are more flexible.
The current NoSQL databases are:-
->Accumulo 
->Cassandra 
->Druid 
->HBase 
->Vertica
->SAP HANA

2)Explain the Differences between Hive and HBase in Brief with examples:-

HIVE:
Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop.
It allows for querying data stored on HDFS for analysis via HQL that gets translated to MapReduce jobs.
Hive should not be used for real-time querying since it could take a while before any results are returned. 

HBASE:
Apache HBase is a NoSQL key/value store which runs on top of HDFS.
HBase operations run in real-time on its database rather than MapReduce jobs.
HBase is perfect for real-time querying of Big Data.
